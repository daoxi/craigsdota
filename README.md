This was a full-stack Angular web project I built long time ago when I was doing my master's degree, please note that **this project has been deprecated** as it hasn't been maintained for quite a while (and the Firebase project used to store database and handle user registration/authentication has been canceled).

This project implements a craigslist/forum-like website for DotA players to find teammates (hence the name), it allows users to register their own account or log in with existing Google/Facebook account, post custom game requests, find suitable friends to play with and much more.

## To launch
```bash
nvm use node
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```
